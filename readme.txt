This game has reached almost all of
its requirements. But to have them
all accomplished it'd be neccesary
to fix the broken Scanner.

To manage the consequence of the
missing data originated by the
missing of working input source
I manage to run the program with
random words that come from the
program dictionary.

It's important to say that this
program doesn't have it's input
source broken on the first inte-
raction, so the first hint is
given by the user.
